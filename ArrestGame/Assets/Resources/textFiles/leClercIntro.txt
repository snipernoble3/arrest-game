:To Self|"Mme. LeClerc is an older woman, who dresses like she believes she is twenty years younger than she is.|:Narrator|"Hello, my name is Bernard d'Andrezy.|:Madame LeClerc|"I am Adrienne LeClerc. Your features remind me of my late husband, although your hair is lighter than his was.|:To Self|"Watching this woman rake me over with her gaze was unsettling. It was almost like she was a parched woman in a desert.|:Narrator|"Oh, I'm very sorry for your loss, madame LeClerc.|:To Self|"She seemed almost...pleased that I was offering sympathy to her. The corners of her lips seemed to practically curl while she flicked her cigarette to get the ashes off.|:Madame LeClerc|"Thank you. I'm doing my best to move on, but sometimes I get rather lonely.|:Narrator|"...|:Madame LeClerc|"Perhaps you could keep me company?|:Narrator|"I'm surprised that you would make such a suggestion, madame LeClerc, what with the rumors of Arsene Lupin on board the ship. How can we know whom to trust?|:To Self|"Actually, I was surprised she would make that suggestion because she is roughly double my age, but I wasn't about to say that to her face.|"At the mention of Lupin, though, she became absolutely agitated.|:Madame LeClerc|"Oh, I am so worried that he will strike while we're out to sea. What if he were to attempt to steal my jewelry?|:Narrator|"I'm sure that the crew is keeping a close eye out for suspicious activities on board.|:Madame LeClerc|"I do hope so.|:To Self|"She took a long drag of her cigarette, and seemed to bury herself in thoughts of her jewelry, so I stepped away from her.|+dMadame LeClerc_Approach;leClercCont|-dMadame LeClerc_Introduce Yourself;leClercIntro|~rDeck
